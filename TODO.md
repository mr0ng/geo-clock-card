# TODO

## v0.3.0

- [x] Meeting planner on geoclock.world: 48 h heat strip under the map
      (96 half-hour cells; tiers green = everyone in work hours,
      yellow = everyone awake 7–21, red = someone asleep — worst
      participant wins), best-window chips, datetime probe, checkbox
      participants ("You" + markers; a resolved "my location" auto
      marker replaces "You"). Scrub/probe time-travels the whole card.
- [x] Card API for the planner: public `previewNow` property (cheap
      full time-travel — no setConfig, tz caches survive; centerLon
      pinned in sun mode so scrubbing doesn't slide the map),
      `resolvedMarkers`/`tzReady` getters, `geoclock-tz-ready` event,
      and bundle-exported scoring helpers (`src/meeting-plan.ts`:
      DST-aware `zoneOffsetMinutes`, `scoreInstant/Range`,
      `bestWindows`) with unit tests.
- [x] `initWebConfig()` now returns `{ getMarkers, isRemembered,
      subscribe }` for sibling page modules.
- [ ] Chrome extension: adopt the planner (build.sh copy + newtab.js
      wiring) if it earns its keep on the demo.
- [x] geoclock.world is an installable PWA with full offline support:
      sw.js (third ASSET_BASE pin, CI-checked in deploy + PR
      workflows) precaches the ~3 MB core at install and backfills
      the remaining monthly imagery in the background (resumable);
      allowlist-only fetch handling keeps wallpaper.html and
      cross-origin (Nominatim) untouched. manifest.webmanifest +
      icon PNGs (scripts/generate-icons.sh from assets/icon-*.svg),
      header "Install app" button, offline badge, offline-aware
      geocode error. Silent updates via versioned cache swap.
      Header CTA relabeled "macOS Wallpaper" (was "Get the Mac app").
- [x] Post-deploy check: `curl -sI https://geoclock.world/manifest.webmanifest`
      serves `application/manifest+json` (and sw.js `text/javascript`)
      — R2's MIME guessing did the right thing, no workflow change
      needed. Verified 2026-09-22.

## v0.2.10

- [x] Full-project code review (card, web, extension, CI) — fixes below.
- [x] Robustness: invalid `locale` or non-numeric config values can no
      longer break the card (Intl probe in setConfig; finite-number
      guards so NaN never reaches clamp()/setInterval). A failed
      timezone-JSON fetch retries on the next setConfig instead of
      caching the rejection forever. Backward clock steps repaint the
      map immediately.
- [x] Perf: tz polygon layers wrapped in Lit `guard()` — hover/hass
      churn no longer re-maps ~540 SVG templates per render. Hover
      highlight now survives the ~2-min polygon rebuilds (tzid compare).
- [x] Parity: `locale` + `showTimezoneRegions` now in the HA visual
      editor; `locale` added to the web/extension Customize panel
      (URL `locale=` param + localStorage). Editor tz-line color picker
      preserves the default 18% alpha on first touch.
- [x] Web: opening a shared link no longer overwrites the viewer's
      saved panel config. Extension "Copy share link" now emits a
      geoclock.world URL (was a dead chrome-extension:// one).
      wallpaper.html `?cfg=` handles base64 `+`/base64url and no longer
      double-decodes; concurrent `geoclockConfigure()` calls can't fire
      a stale `geoclock-ready`.
- [x] CI: immutable-path guard now covers every dist/ file (was JS
      only); site sync gets `Cache-Control: no-cache`; versioned assets
      upload before the HTML that pins them; PR test workflow (ci.yml);
      release.yml asserts tag == package.json version; dropped the .gz
      release asset (HACS was installing it as junk).
- [x] Housekeeping: sanitizers extracted to `src/config-utils.ts` with
      unit tests; README documents day/night marker colors; docs/web
      README rewritten to match the automated deploy; fetch-imagery.sh
      works on Linux (ImageMagick fallback).
- [ ] Deferred from review: `sortByVisualArea` re-parses ~1 MB of path
      data per rebuild (cache per tzid); per-pointermove
      getBoundingClientRect outside rAF; editor can't unset day/night
      marker colors once touched (YAML-only to clear).

## Stage 1 — minimum viable visual

- [x] Project scaffold (rollup, ts, vitest, hacs.json)
- [x] Solar math (`sun.ts`) with tests
- [x] Terminator polygon (`terminator.ts`) with tests
- [x] Equirectangular projection (`projection.ts`) with tests
- [x] Lit element with SVG mask + feathered terminator
- [x] Local time + UTC + date readout
- [x] NASA Blue/Black Marble fetch script
- [x] First in-Home-Assistant test
- [x] HACS metadata polish + first tagged release (v0.1.x, v0.2.x shipped)

## Stage 2 — time-zone affordances

- [x] Hour band across the top: 1..12 numbers per 15° column, noon/midnight highlighted
- [x] Tick marks at 15° intervals
- [x] CSS theming hooks (`--geo-tz-*`)
- [x] Recenter the map on the antimeridian (Geochron-style: Pacific in the middle, dateline at center)
- [x] Real political time-zone boundary overlay (Natural Earth 10m, simplified to ~62 KB via mapshaper)
- [x] Tick on seconds (default `updateInterval: 1`)
- [ ] Dateline indicator (`Friday ◀ ▶ Thursday`) — now feasible since the dateline runs through the center; deferred for user feedback first

## Stage 3 — decisions deferred to here

- [x] Monthly Blue Marble variant (auto-pick by current month) — 24 frames (start + mid each month) shipped via day-image.ts
- [ ] Better terminator: WebGL/canvas with sun-elevation alpha + tinted twilight
- [x] Bundling strategy: imagery ships alongside the JS bundle in dist/, copied by HACS / manual install
- [x] Location pins (config + HA zones) — `markers:` array with per-marker label + color, always-visible or hover label modes
- [x] Configurable main-clock time source (home/device/entity, default `home`) — **breaking change** in 0.2.0: pre-0.2.0 cards behaved like `device`
- [ ] Optional: alternate projection (Mercator)
- [x] Lovelace visual config editor

## Quality / housekeeping (ongoing)

- [ ] Add a render snapshot test using JSDOM to lock in SVG output for fixed timestamps
- [x] Storybook-ish demo page in `dev/` for local visual iteration without HA (dev/index.html with sliders)
- [x] CI: GitHub Actions running `npm test` and `npm run build` (ci.yml on PRs + release.yml + deploy-site.yml)
- [x] Optimize IANA timezone lookup performance via 4-decimal coordinates caching (v0.2.3)
- [x] Fix out-of-bounds wrapped longitudes in timezone polygon searches (v0.2.3)
- [x] Retain and preserve custom alpha transparency in Lovelace visual color editor pickers (v0.2.3)

## v0.2.9

- [x] Localized timezone names + new `locale` config option. The long
      zone-name formatter no longer hardcodes en-US, so the hover popup's
      timezone name localizes (e.g. "heure d'été du Pacifique" under fr).
      The optional `locale` (BCP-47) overrides the browser default and is
      threaded through every formatter — popup name, clock readout, marker
      times, offset-band fallback — so a set locale is consistent. Unset =
      follow the viewer's browser language. YAML-only (not in the editor).

## v0.2.8

- [x] Web demo fullscreen now LETTERBOXES instead of cropping to
      full-bleed. The markers are an HTML overlay positioned by
      percentage of the frame, which only aligns with the SVG map when
      the frame keeps the viewBox aspect ratio; the old slice/crop path
      made markers drift. The card publishes its aspect ratio as
      `--geo-frame-ar` so `setCardFullBleed()` can fit the frame to the
      viewport (`min(100vh, 100vw / AR)`), centered with black bars.

## v0.2.7

- [x] Split the timezone overlay into two independently-toggleable layers:
      new `showTimezoneRegions` flag controls the colored vertical offset
      bands; `showTimezoneBoundaries` now gates only the IANA hover/identify
      popup. `showTimezoneRegions` defaults to `showTimezoneBoundaries`, so
      existing HA configs and the visual editor are unchanged. The
      geoclock.world demo groups the bands with the hour band ("Hour & zone
      bands" toggle) and reserves the timezone toggle for the popup.
- [x] Hover popups self-dismiss after 30s of no pointer movement (a parked
      cursor never fires pointerleave, so the popup would otherwise stick).
- [x] Hide the demo's Customize button + slide-out panel in fullscreen
      (the panel lives outside the fullscreen `.stage` and can't overlay it).

## v0.2.6

- [x] Day/night marker colors (opt-in): per-marker `dayColor`/`nightColor`
      + card-level `markerDayColor`/`markerNightColor`; each dot recolors
      live as the terminator crosses its location (matches the wallpaper
      app). Exposed in the visual editor and YAML. Existing single-color
      cards unchanged.
- [x] geoclock.world config panel: slide-out "Customize" — set center
      (sun / fixed longitude / your location), add markers by place name
      (Nominatim) or geolocation, day/night marker colors, and toggle the
      hour band / TZ boundaries / UTC line. Round-trips through readable
      URL params (History API) for shareable links + opt-in localStorage.
- [x] Refactor the HA-impedance-matching (expandShortcuts) + mount helpers
      out of wallpaper.html into a shared headless module
      (geoclock-config.js) imported by both web pages.

## v0.2.5 (stable)

- [x] Ultrawide / letterbox rendering: night mask, twilight glow, hour band,
      and TZ boundaries wrap-tile across the seam so they fill displays wider
      than the 2048×1068 viewBox (fullscreen + wallpaper use cases)
- [x] Render performance: memoized terminator geometry, rAF-throttled hover,
      quantized TZ re-projection (0.5° threshold), `<use>`-ref wrap copies
      instead of duplicated subtrees, non-reactive TZ polygon fields (no
      double render)
- [x] Work around WebKit filtered-mask viewport clip (night layer truncating
      with a hard edge that moved with aspect-fit mode)
- [x] Coarsen + cap the IANA tz cache (~1 km keys, 512-entry bound) so moving
      device_trackers can't grow it unbounded
- [x] Restrict `imageryBase` to http(s)/page-scheme (config can arrive from a
      URL param on the demo page)
- [x] Editor: NaN guard on number fields, twilight-color hex normalization,
      corrected brightness/contrast ranges and entity-fallback help text
- [x] Short weekday in marker times ("Wed" not "Wednesday")
- [x] Deploy hygiene: CI enforces ASSET_BASE pins match package.json and
      refuses to overwrite an immutable versioned path with changed content
