# `docs/web/` — geoclock.world site

Source for the live demo at <https://geoclock.world>. Single origin
behind Cloudflare: HTML and every card asset (JS bundle, NASA imagery,
IANA GeoJSON) are served from `geoclock.world`, all backed by one
Cloudflare R2 bucket bound to the custom domain.

## Files

- [`index.html`](index.html) — the single-page site. One constant
  (`ASSET_BASE`) controls which release of the card the demo loads;
  bumped in lockstep with `package.json#version` (CI enforces this).
- [`wallpaper.html`](wallpaper.html) — chrome-less, full-bleed
  render of the card meant to be screenshotted and set as a
  desktop wallpaper. Accepts the full card config via
  `?cfg=<base64-or-JSON>` (URL form), or via
  `window.geoclockConfigure({ config, hass })` (JS API form — used
  by the macOS wallpaper app). See the in-file header comment for
  the supported shortcuts (inline-coordinate markers,
  `mainTimeZone`, `centerLatitude` / `centerLongitude`). Carries its
  own `ASSET_BASE` pin, also CI-checked.
- [`privacy.html`](privacy.html) — privacy policy for the site and
  the Chrome new-tab extension (the Web Store listing links here).
- [`geoclock-config.js`](geoclock-config.js) — shared HEADLESS
  config plumbing (shortcut expansion, bundle loading, asset
  readiness). Imported by `index.html`, `wallpaper.html`, the Chrome
  extension, and bundled into the macOS wallpaper and
  [community Windows](https://github.com/mr0ng/geo-clock-card) apps.
- [`geoclock-webconfig.js`](geoclock-webconfig.js) — the slide-out
  Customize panel (URL codec, localStorage, Nominatim geocoding,
  panel DOM). Imported by `index.html`, the Chrome extension, and the
  community Windows app, which enables the opt-in `offline` mode for
  manual coordinates without live location, place search, or share links.
  `initWebConfig()` returns a small read-only API
  (`getMarkers` / `isRemembered` / `subscribe`) consumed by the
  planner module below.
  **Moving or renaming either JS module breaks
  `chrome-extension/build.sh`, the macOS app's `sync-web-assets.sh`,
  and external consumers such as the community Windows fork —
  update the in-repo consumers in the same commit and coordinate
  with the external ones.**
- [`geoclock-planner.js`](geoclock-planner.js) — the meeting-planner
  strip below the map (48 h heat strip, best-window chips, datetime
  probe, participant checkboxes). Scoring math comes from the card
  bundle's exports (`src/meeting-plan.ts`); time-travel preview uses
  the card's public `previewNow` property. Imported by `index.html`
  and the community Windows app. The Chrome extension doesn't ship it yet (adopting it needs
  a copy line in `chrome-extension/build.sh` plus wiring in
  `newtab.js`). Never load it from `wallpaper.html` or the macOS
  app. Own localStorage key `geoclock.planner.v1`, written only
  while "Remember on this browser" is on.
- [`geoclock-pwa.js`](geoclock-pwa.js) — PWA plumbing for the demo
  page: registers `sw.js`, shows the header "Install app" button
  (beforeinstallprompt), the offline badge, and triggers the imagery
  backfill. Imported by `index.html` ONLY — never wallpaper.html
  (macOS screenshot pipeline) and not copied by the extension or
  mac-app sync scripts.
- [`sw.js`](sw.js) — the service worker. Carries the **third
  ASSET_BASE pin** (CI-checked alongside index.html and
  wallpaper.html). Cache model: core precache at install (~3 MB:
  shell, bundle, tz JSONs, night layer, ~5 weeks of day imagery),
  then a resumable sequential backfill of the remaining monthly
  frames on a message from `geoclock-pwa.js`. Fetch handling is
  allowlist-only: cache-first for immutable `/v*/` assets,
  network-first for the shell; cross-origin (Nominatim) and
  non-shell pages (wallpaper.html, about.html, …) are never
  intercepted. Updates are silent — new pin ⇒ new cache, old caches
  purged on activate.
- [`manifest.webmanifest`](manifest.webmanifest) — install manifest
  (`.webmanifest`, not `.json`, to avoid confusion with the
  extension's `manifest.json`).
- [`preview.png`](preview.png) — screenshot used by the project's
  root README and as the page's OpenGraph image.
- [`favicon.svg`](favicon.svg) /
  [`apple-touch-icon.png`](apple-touch-icon.png) — site icons.
- `icon-192.png` / `icon-512.png` / `icon-512-maskable.png` — PWA
  install icons, rendered from `assets/icon-source.svg` +
  `assets/icon-maskable.svg` (same globe as favicon.svg and the
  macOS app icon — keep them in sync) by
  `scripts/generate-icons.sh`. Committed; regenerate only when the
  brand mark changes.

No `CNAME` or `.nojekyll` files: those are GitHub Pages conventions.
Cloudflare uses dashboard-configured custom domains and serves files
verbatim — neither file is consulted, so we don't ship them.

## Deployment topology

Single bucket, single domain. The R2 bucket `geoclock-world` is
custom-domain-bound to `geoclock.world` and serves both the site
(everything in `docs/web/`) and the versioned card assets
(`/v<X.Y.Z>/...`).

```

The card's `imageryBase` resolves from `import.meta.url` — i.e. the
directory containing the loaded JS bundle. Because the bundle and all
imagery sit under the same `/v<X.Y.Z>/` prefix, no manual
`imageryBase` override is needed: once the import succeeds, every
imagery / GeoJSON fetch already points at the right path.

## How deployment actually runs

Everything is automated in
[`.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml`](../../.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml),
which runs on every push to `main`:

1. `npm ci && npm test && npm run build` — `dist/` is rebuilt from
   source (the build is deterministic, so this matches the committed
   bundle for the same commit).
2. Guard: both HTML `ASSET_BASE` pins must reference
   `/v<package.json#version>` or the deploy fails.
3. Guard: if any file already exists under `/v<version>/` on the
   bucket with different content, the deploy fails — immutable paths
   are never rewritten; bump the version instead.
4. `dist/` syncs to `/v<version>/` with a 1-year immutable
   `Cache-Control` (assets first, so live HTML never pins a missing
   path).
5. `docs/web/` syncs to the bucket root with `Cache-Control:
   no-cache` (mutable files revalidate at the edge). `--delete`
   removes dropped files, with `--exclude 'v*/*'` protecting the
   versioned prefixes.

Required repo secrets:

| Secret | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Cloudflare → R2 → Manage R2 API Tokens |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | (same flow) |
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare dashboard → right column → "Account ID" |

### Bucket + DNS one-time wiring

1. Create the R2 bucket `geoclock-world`.
2. Bind it to the custom domain `geoclock.world`
   (R2 → bucket → Settings → Custom Domains → Connect domain).
   Cloudflare provisions the DNS record + TLS cert.
3. The bucket serves `index.html` at `/` automatically (R2 supports
   index document configuration in Custom Domains settings).

## Bumping the live demo to a new release

One commit, three edits, then push:

1. Bump `version` in `package.json`.
2. Update the `ASSET_BASE` pin in [`index.html`](index.html) **and**
   [`wallpaper.html`](wallpaper.html) to the same `/vX.Y.Z`.
3. Push to `main` — CI verifies the pins, uploads the new `/vX.Y.Z/`
   assets, and syncs the site. Old prefixes stay forever, so older
   snapshots of the demo remain reachable by editing one URL.

Visitors with the previous bundle still cached load it only until the
HTML revalidates (no-cache); the new asset path is a fresh URL so the
browser fetches it cleanly without a cache bust.

## Local testing

```bash
# Serve docs/web/ at http://localhost:8080
python3 -m http.server -d docs/web 8080

# Separately, make /v<version>/ resolve to the freshly-built dist/ so
# the relative ASSET_BASE works locally too (match the version pinned
# in index.html). Simplest is a symlink:
ln -s ../../dist docs/web/v0.2.10
# (delete the symlink before committing so it doesn't end up in git)
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> and confirm the card mounts, imagery
loads, and time-zone hover works.

Two service-worker hygiene rules when testing locally:

- **Use a fresh port after editing served JS.** The browser
  memory-caches ES modules (python's server sends no cache headers),
  so a plain reload on a previously-used port can run a stale mix of
  old and new modules. A new port = a new origin = a cold cache.
- **Unregister the SW and delete its caches when done** — a leftover
  `localhost:<port>` service worker will cache-first-hijack `/v*`
  paths for whatever you serve on that port next. In the console:

  ```js
  navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(rs => rs.forEach(r => r.unregister()));
  caches.keys().then(ks => ks.forEach(k => caches.delete(k)));
  ```

## When the logo arrives

Drop `logo.svg` into this folder, then in `index.html` replace the
header's `<div class="wordmark">` block with whatever combination
of logo + wordmark the design calls for. It deploys with the next
push to `main`.
